## PROMPT For generating Problem Statements Requirements
You must include the following in their Git repository for the chosen option:
A.
Markdown file for Problem Statement, ProblemStatement.md.
To know more about Markdown files, refer here (or any other source you like) https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/
The problem statement must address:
a.
Pain point, primary users, and why the problem matters.
b.
Scope and explicit out-of-scope features. TELL THIS AND MY  CASE IS THIS 
HR CV–JD Match Assistant Design an HR assistant that helps a recruiter quickly see how well a candidate’s CV matches a specific advertised job. The system should accept a CV and a Job Description (JD), extract key elements such as skills, experience, and qualifications, and compute a simple match indication (for example, a percentage score or Low/Medium/High). It should also highlight the main reasons for this assessment, such as strong overlaps or missing key skills. Design a minimal tool that can support a recruiter’s initial screening and help candidates understand how well they fit in a role.

Design a minimal tool that can support a recruiter’s initial screening and help candidates understand how well they fit in a role. I WANT TO DESIGN A SINGLE PAGE WEB APP WHICH HAVE ASSISTANT THAT PROVIDES JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE A BUTTON TO UPLOAD A CV AND A ENTER BUTTON BY ENTERING IT MATCHES THE CV THAT HOW MUCH IT MATCHES TO THE GIVEN REQUIREMENTS ACCORDINGLIY (% SCORE AND LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) I WANT YOU TO MAKE INTERFACE DESIGN OF THIS.
# For other half (right side)
It should also highlight the main reasons for this assessment, such as strong overlaps or missing key skills. now make another page which will show case Shows match score + matching skills + missing skills when analyze match button is clicked.

## PROMPT for generating use cases
Use Cases & Design
o
At least 3 detailed use cases.
o
Simple high-level design / data-flow description. make me

## PROMPT FOR UI SKETCH VISION 
UI-Sketch-and-Vision (file or .md) – UI sketch/wireframe for a future, more complete product, plus a short explanation of main UI ideas. UI Sketch & Vision o A simple UI sketch or wireframe (image or markdown-based ASCII/PlantUML) showing how the “final product” UI might look if this system were fully developed beyond the MVP. o 1–2 paragraphs explaining key UI decisions (for example, how information is organized, how the user flow supports the pain point). do it

## PROMPT FOR MAKING ROADMAP
G.
Release & Evolution Plan
o
A short “release roadmap” (for example, 3-month, 1-year, 2-year view) describing how the product could evolve over time.
o
At each stage, a few bullet points of planned improvements (for example, better algorithms, more data sources, richer UI, integrations, analytics), to emphasize product longevity and lifecycle thinking. add one extra feature in this roadmap that share button and shortlist button will be functional  later and remaining thing you do

## Reflection: Help vs Risks
### **Help**
- Speed up ideation and design creation.
- Faster prototyping of UI and working features.
- Clearer requirements and code structure suggestions.

### **Risks**
- Over-reliance may reduce original creativity.
- AI-generated code may contain security or performance issues.
- Privacy concerns when pasting sensitive project data into prompts.
