HR CV–JD Match Assistant Design an HR assistant that helps a recruiter quickly see how well a candidate’s CV matches a specific advertised job. The system should accept a CV and a Job Description (JD), extract key elements such as skills, experience, and qualifications, and compute a simple match indication (for example, a percentage score or Low/Medium/High). It should also highlight the main reasons for this assessment, such as strong overlaps or missing key skills. Design a minimal tool that can support a recruiter’s initial screening and help candidates understand how well they fit in a role.
