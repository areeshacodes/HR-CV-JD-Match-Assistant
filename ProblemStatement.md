# Problem Statement
Recruiters receive hundreds of job applications for a single role, and manually checking each CV against the Job Description (JD) is time-consuming and inconsistent.
This leads to slow hiring processes, poor shortlisting decisions, and confusion for both recruiters and applicants.

## (A) Pain Points
# For Recruiters
Time-consuming manual CV screening.
Difficulty identifying missing or weak skills quickly
No consistent scoring or evaluation method

# For Candidates
No clear understanding of how well they fit a role
Difficult to identify which skills they should improve
Unsure why they are not shortlisted

## Primary Users
# Recruiters / HR Professionals
They use the system to:
Upload CV and JD.
Instantly see a match score
Read reasons for match or mismatch

# Job Applicants / Candidates
They use the system to:
Check how suitable they are for a job
Learn which skills they are missing
Improve their CV accordingly

# Why This Problem Matters
Speeds up recruitment process
Helps companies find better-matched candidates
Helps job applicants understand and improve their fit
Increases hiring accuracy and fairness

## (B) Scope (What the System Will Do)
✔ Accept CV 
✔ Accept Job Description (JD)
✔ Extract key elements:
Skills, Experience, Qualifications
✔ Generate a match score (percentage or Low/Medium/High)

## Out-of-Scope (What the System Will Not Do)
❌ No CV editing or rewriting
❌ No automated interview scheduling
❌ No multi-language NLP (English only for now)
❌ no share and shortlist button working right now
