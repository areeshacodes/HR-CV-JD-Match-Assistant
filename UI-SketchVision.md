## Paragrapgh explaining key UI decision
The final product aims to provide recruiters and job seekers with a clean, structured, and fast way to understand how well a CV matches a job description. The layout is intentionally divided into two main areas: inputs on the left (CV & JD uploads) and analysis output on the right. This keeps the workflow linear and easy: upload → analyze → read results. Action buttons such as Extract Skills and Generate Match Score are placed close to the upload section to reduce cognitive load and keep all primary interactions in one place.

The results section emphasizes clarity by using a visual match score, categorized lists (Top Skills, Missing Skills), and clear indicators like checkmarks to highlight strengths. A detailed report option gives users deeper insight without overwhelming the main screen. Export options at the bottom (PDF, Word, Copy) support real recruiter needs, especially for documentation and sharing. Overall, the UI design focuses on simplicity, speed, and reducing recruiter pain points by showing results immediately and clearly.
